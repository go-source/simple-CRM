# simple-CRM
Contact Management Joomla component designed to be easy to use. 

## Features (v.1.0.0):
- Accounts: create/edit/delete business or person accounts, and relations can be set.
- Notes: annotation of conversations with accounts
- Opportunities: classifications of the conversations to close a deal
- Orders: conversions of opportunities to orders

Leads are considered the first stage of opportunities while orders are created when opportunities are closed won. The sales stage is set by users using the opportunities form.

Relations include business (works for, assistant of or belongs to groups) and individual family relationships (parents, children, etc). The family relationships is useful for non-profit fund raising and associations.

## Help needed

Help improve this project. We need UX/designers to build atractive views and easier navigation. Help integrate simple-CRM with other Joomla! components, like capturing contacts and integrating with mail solutions.

## Installation:

Simple CRM requires FOF3 https://github.com/akeeba/fof, included in the installation package. The component installs like any Joomla component.

## Roadmap:

At actual stage the component is fully functional and new functionality can be asked through "issues" on the project GitHub page.

## Changes stopped Feb/2020

Component is functional but further development requires updating F0F, PHP and Joomla 4.0
